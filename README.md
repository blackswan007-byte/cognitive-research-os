**COGNITIVE RESEARCH OS (CROS)**

An Agentic Framework for Strategic Intelligence, Data Auditing, and Lateral Innovation.

Status: Active

Methodology: Agentic Patterns

Architecture: Multi-Agent


**PHILOSOPHY**

Cognitive Research OS (CROS) is a structured operating system designed to externalize the cognitive processes of a researcher.

Traditional research is often opaque, clients see the final Result, not the rigorous logic behind it. CROS applies Software Engineering principles to Intelligence Analysis, decomposing complex reasoning into modular, interacting agents.

This framework is built upon the principles of "Agentic Design Patterns" (Gulli, 2025), shifting from simple zero-shot prompting to complex Multi-Agent Orchestration.


**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

The system operates on three distinct cognitive verticals, located in the /src directory:

1. The Core Research Suite (Logical Deduction)
Path: src/core-research/
Implements Prompt Chaining and Reflection Patterns to simulate a rigorous desk research workflow.

* [01] Context Architect: Generates high-fidelity "Hybrid Reality" environments (Digital Data + Field Observations).
* [02] Analytical Engine: A dedicated logic processor that performs "Stream of Consciousness" auditing and cross-verification.
* [03] Narrative Curator: Transforms raw deductions into high-level "Technical Memoirs."

2. The Forensic Audit Suite (Technical Verification)
Path: src/forensic-audit/

* The Data Inquisitor: An automated forensic auditor utilizing Python Tool Use to perform statistical stress tests (Benford's Law, Isolation Forest) on raw datasets. It operates on a "Guilty until proven innocent" philosophy.

3. The Lateral Innovation Suite (Creative Synthesis)
Path: src/lateral-thinking/

* The Da Vinci Engine: A polymathic agent designed to break "Functional Fixedness" by forcing domain shifts (e.g., solving business problems using principles from Evolutionary Biology).


**USAGE GUIDE**

Running the Core Research Loop:

1. Feed the topic to src/core-research/01_context_architect.md.
2. Pass the output raw fragments to src/core-research/02_analytical_engine.md.
3. Finalize the insight by passing the deduction log to src/core-research/03_narrative_curator.md.

Running the Forensic Audit:

1. Provide a CSV dataset.
2. Activate src/forensic-audit/the_data_inquisitor.md in an environment capable of Python execution.

**DISCLAIMER**

This repository documents a Human-in-the-Loop methodology. The agents provide the raw cognitive horsepower, but the strategic direction and final ethical judgment remain with the human operator.
