🧠 Philosophy

Cognitive Research OS (CROS) is a structured operating system designed to externalize the cognitive processes of a researcher.
Traditional research is often opaque, clients see the final result, not the rigorous logic behind it. CROS applies Software Engineering principlee to Intelligence Analysis, decomposing complex reasoning into modular, interacting agents. This framework is built upon the principles of Agentic Design Patterns (Gulli, 2025), shifting from simple zero-shot prompting to complex Multi-Agent Orchestration

🏗️ System Architecture

The system operates on three distinct cognitive verticals, located in the `/src` directory:

1. The Core Research Suite (Logical Deduction)
    Path: `src/core-research/, Implements Prompt Chaining and Reflection Patterns to simulate a rigorous desk research workflow.

[01] Context Architect:** Generates high-fidelity "Hybrid Reality" environments (Digital Data + Field Observations).
[02] Analytical Engine: A dedicated logic processor that performs "Stream of Consciousness" auditing and cross-verification.
[03] Narrative Curator: Transforms raw deductions into high-level "Technical Memoirs.

2. The Forensic Audit Suite (Technical Verification)
Path: `src/forensic-audit/`*

The Data Inquisitor: An automated forensic auditor utilizing Python Tool Use to perform statistical stress tests (Benford's Law, Isolation Forest) on raw datasets. It operates on a "Guilty until proven innocent" philosophy.

3. The Lateral Innovation Suite (Creative Synthesis)
Path: src/lateral-thinking/

The Da Vinci Engine: A polymathic agent designed to break "Functional Fixedness" by forcing domain shifts.

📚 Design Patterns Implemented

This repository serves as a practical implementation of the following academic patterns referenced in *Agentic Design Patterns* (Gulli, 2024):

| Pattern | Implementation | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reflection | The Analytical Engine critiques its own initial findings before forming a conclusion. | Chapter 4 |
| Tool Use | The *Data Inquisitor is mandated to execute Python code for statistical validation. | Chapter 5 |
| Persona-Based | Each agent adopts a distinct cognitive stance (Skeptic, Polymath, Auditor). | Chapter 7 |
| Chain-of-Thought | The *Narrative Curator relies on the step-by-step logic logs generated by previous agents. | Chapter 1 |

🚀 Usage Guide

Running the Core Research Loop
1.  Feed the topic to `src/core-research/01_context_architect.md`.
2.  Pass the output raw fragments to `src/core-research/02_analytical_engine.md`.
3.  Finalize the insight by passing the deduction log to `src/core-research/03_narrative_curator.md`.

Running the Forensic Audit
1.  Provide a CSV dataset.
2.  Activate `src/forensic-audit/the_data_inquisitor.md` in an environment capable of Python execution (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis).

⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository documents a Human-in-the-Loop methodology. The agents provide the raw cognitive horsepower, but the strategic direction and final ethical judgment remain with the human operator.
