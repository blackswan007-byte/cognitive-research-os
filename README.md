**Philosophy**  
Cognitive Research OS (CROS) is a structured operating system designed to externalize the cognitive processes of a Market researcher.

Traditional research is often opaque clients see the final Result, not the rigorous logic behind it. CROS applies Software Engineering principles o Intelligence Analysis, decomposing complex reasoning into modular, interacting agents.

This framework is built upon the principles of "Agentic Design Patterns" (Gulli, 2024), shifting from simple zero-shot prompting to complex Multi-Agent Orchestration

**System Architecture**
The system operates on three distinct cognitive verticals, located in the \`/src\` directory:

  1. The Core Research Suite (Logical Deduction)  
\*Path: \`src/core-research/\`\*

Implements \*\*Prompt Chaining\*\* and \*\*Reflection Patterns\*\* to simulate a rigorous desk research workflow.  
\* \*\*\[01\] Context Architect:\*\* Generates high-fidelity "Hybrid Reality" environments (Digital Data \+ Field Observations).  
\* \*\*\[02\] Analytical Engine:\*\* A dedicated logic processor that performs "Stream of Consciousness" auditing and cross-verification.  
\* \*\*\[03\] Narrative Curator:\*\* Transforms raw deductions into high-level "Technical Memoirs."

\#\#\# 2\. The Forensic Audit Suite (Technical Verification)  
\*Path: \`src/forensic-audit/\`\*

\* \*\*The Data Inquisitor:\*\* An automated forensic auditor utilizing \*\*Python Tool Use\*\* to perform statistical stress tests (Benford's Law, Isolation Forest) on raw datasets. It operates on a "Guilty until proven innocent" philosophy.

\#\#\# 3\. The Lateral Innovation Suite (Creative Synthesis)  
\*Path: \`src/lateral-thinking/\`\*

\* \*\*The Da Vinci Engine:\*\* A polymathic agent designed to break "Functional Fixedness" by forcing domain shifts (e.g., solving business problems using principles from Evolutionary Biology).

\#\# 📚 Design Patterns Implemented

This repository serves as a practical implementation of the following academic patterns referenced in \*Agentic Design Patterns\* (Gulli, 2024):

| Pattern | Implementation | Reference |  
| :--- | :--- | :--- |  
| \*\*Reflection\*\* | The \*Analytical Engine\* critiques its own initial findings before forming a conclusion. | \*Chapter 4\* |  
| \*\*Tool Use\*\* | The \*Data Inquisitor\* is mandated to execute Python code for statistical validation. | \*Chapter 5\* |  
| \*\*Persona-Based\*\* | Each agent adopts a distinct cognitive stance (Skeptic, Polymath, Auditor). | \*Chapter 7\* |  
| \*\*Chain-of-Thought\*\* | The \*Narrative Curator\* relies on the step-by-step logic logs generated by previous agents. | \*Chapter 1\* |

\#\# 🚀 Usage Guide

\#\#\# Running the Core Research Loop  
1\.  \*\*Feed\*\* the topic to \`src/core-research/01\_context\_architect.md\`.  
2\.  \*\*Pass\*\* the output raw fragments to \`src/core-research/02\_analytical\_engine.md\`.  
3\.  \*\*Finalize\*\* the insight by passing the deduction log to \`src/core-research/03\_narrative\_curator.md\`.

\#\#\# Running the Forensic Audit  
1\.  Provide a CSV dataset.  
2\.  Activate \`src/forensic-audit/the\_data\_inquisitor.md\` in an environment capable of Python execution (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis).

\#\# ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This repository documents a \*\*Human-in-the-Loop\*\* methodology. The agents provide the raw cognitive horsepower, but the strategic direction and final ethical judgment remain with the human operator.
